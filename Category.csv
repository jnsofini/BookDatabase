Category_ID,Description
"Foundation of Mathematics ","This deals with the mathematical investigation of what underlines the philosophical theories concerning the nature of mathematics. It include set theory and mathematical logic."
"Number Theory","This is the study of numbers and the properties of operations between them. It encompasses: Arithmetic, Elementary number theory, Analytic number theory, and Algebraic number theory."
Algebra,"This is a broad subject including Order theory, General algebraic systems, Field theory and polynomials, and (non) commutative rings and algebras."
Combinatorics,"This is the study of finite or discrete collections of objects that satisfy specified criteria."
Geometry,"This covers spatial relationships, using fundamental qualities or axioms. The topics are: Convex geometry, Discrete and combinatorial geometry, Differential geometry and Algebraic geometry."
Topology,"Deals with the properties of a figure that do not change when the figure is continuously deformed. The main areas are point set topology (or general topology), algebraic topology and topology of manifolds."
"Probability and Statistics ","Generally the two subjects deal with the mathematical theory of random phenomena as well as the science of making effective use of numerical data from experiments or from populations of individuals."
"Computational Mathematics ","It's divided into Numerical analysis and Computer algebra."
"Classical mechanics","This is a model of the physics of forces acting upon bodies; includes sub-fields to describe the behaviors of solids, gases, and fluids."
"Thermodynamics and statistical mechanics","It studies the effects of changes in temperature, pressure, and volume on physical systems on the macroscopic scale, and the transfer of energy as heat."
"Electromagnetism and photonics","The study of the behaviours of electrons, electric media, magnets, magnetic fields, and general interactions of light."
"Relativistic mechanics","The special theory of relativity enjoys a relationship with electromagnetism and mechanics. It's divided into Special and General relativity."
"Quantum mechanics, atomic physics, and molecular physics","This is the branch of physics treating atomic and subatomic systems and their interaction based on the observation that all forms of energy are released in discrete units or bundles called ""quanta""."
"Data Science","This is the field of study that combines domain expertise, programming skills, and knowledge of mathematics and statistics to extract meaningful insights from data."
C,"C is a computer programming language. That means that you can use C to create lists of instructions for a computer to follow. The C program is the human-readable form, while the executable that comes out of the compiler is the machine-readable and executable form."
C++,"C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications. It is an extension to the C language. C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory."
Python,"An interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together."
"Personal Development","This covers subject to improve awareness and identity, develop talents and potential, build human capital, facilitate employability, and enhance the quality of life and the realization of dreams and aspirations. Personal development can take place over the course of a person's entire life."
"Religious Book","This is all about books related to religious matters."
